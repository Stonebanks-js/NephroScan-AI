# Q: What is the importance of a logger file?
# A: Records important events, errors, and execution flow for debugging and monitoring.

# Q: What happens if I donâ€™t create a logger?
# A: No history of program execution, making debugging and issue tracking difficult.

# Q: What are the disadvantages of not creating logs?
# A: 
# - Cannot trace errors after execution.
# - Hard to reproduce bugs due to missing execution history.
# - No performance tracking or analysis.

# Q: Where can I get stuck without logs?
# A: 
# - During debugging, unable to identify failure points.
# - In production, no clues about what went wrong.

# Q: Why record time, date, and message in logs?
# A: Helps pinpoint when, where, and in which module an issue occurred.

# Q: How do logs help me travel through all files?
# A: Unified logging across modules lets you trace execution steps chronologically.

# Q: How can I access logs?
# A: 
# - From the logs/ directory (log file).
# - From the console output while the program runs.
